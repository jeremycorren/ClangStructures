## ClangStructures

Implementations of data structures in C. API design inspired by _The C Programming Language_ by K&R and Columbia's COMS-3157 systems programming course. Data structures are type-agnostic, capable of storing and operating on any type.

Includes:
- `linkedlist`, a singly linked list with generic stack-like support for pushing, popping, removal, traversal and more.
- `binarytree`, a binary search tree with generic support for insertion and traversal.
