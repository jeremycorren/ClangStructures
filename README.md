## ClangStructures

Implementations of data structures in C. API design inspired by _The C Programming Language_ by K&R and Columbia's COMS-3157 systems programming course. Data structures are type-agnostic, capable of storing and operating on any type.

Includes:
- `linked-list`: a singly-linked list with generic stack-like support for pushing, popping, removal, traversal, reversal, and more.
- `binary-tree`: a binary search tree with generic support for insertion and traversal.
- `hash-map`: a hash map implementing separate chaining with support for insertion and lookup.
